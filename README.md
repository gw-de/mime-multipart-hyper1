Rust library for MIME multipart parsing, construction, and streaming compatible with hyper v1.x

This is a fork of https://github.com/mikedilger/mime-multipart with support for newer hyper versions.

Documentation is available at https://docs.rs/mime-multipart-hyper1

## Compatibility

* **Version 0.8**
  * Use Rust version 2021
  * Update hyper from 0.10 to 0.11
  * Updates mime crate to version 0.3 (up-to-date at time of writing, November 2024)
* **Version 0.9**
  * Update hyper to 0.14 (also compatible with hyper 0.12 and 0.13)
* **Version 0.10**
  * Replace hyper dependency with http crate. This makes this crate compatible with hyper 1.x

## Features

* Parses from a stream, rather than in memory, so that memory is not hogged.
* Streams parts which are identified as files (via the part's Content-Disposition header,
  if any, or via a manual override) to files on disk.
* Uses buffered streams.
* Lets you build and stream out a multipart as a vector of parts (`Node`s), some of which
  could be files, others could be nested multipart parts.

If you are specifically dealing with `multipart/formdata`, you may be interested in
https://github.com/mikedilger/formdata which uses this crate and takes it a step
further.
